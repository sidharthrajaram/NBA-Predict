A fun little summer project to predict how good NBA players can become based on their rookie stats. :basketball: 

### some popular predictions of the 2017 class (still changing)
###### KEY: 5+ generational talent, 4+ all star, 3+ star, 2+ starter, 1+ bench player, 0+ low ceiling
| Player Name        | Prediction       | 
|:-------------:|:-------------:| 
| `Ben Simmons`| 3.75 | 
| `Lauri Markkanen`| 3.75  | 
| `Donovan Mitchell` 		| 3.75   |
| `Jayson Tatum` 		| 5.0  |
| `De'Aaron Fox` 		| 2.5      |
| `Malik Monk` 		|  1.25 |

### some (of the gazillion) numbers we track

| Metric        | Purpose       | 
|:-------------:|:-------------:| 
| `per`         | overall efficiency  | 
| `bpm`         | box plus/minus      | 
| `vorp` 		| value over replacement      |
| `usage` 		| usage %!      |
| `tov%` 		| mistake rate      |
| `ts%` 		| scoring skill      |
| `war` 		| record orientation      |
| `WS` 		| win shares (!)      |

### how it works 
We look at a broad sample set of (current and former) NBA players and their rookie statlines. Once we've done that we begin to track certain "between-the-lines" metrics that can give the best insight as to what rookie tendencies and on-court habits resulted in the development of stars. We then apply that model on **n** number of players' rookie statlines and then can see whether or not they may become stars. A good example of this would be Jimmy Butler. As a rookie, Jimmy Butler averaged 2.6 points and other absymal on-the-surface numbers, but our model was able to indicate that he had a solid chance at stardom. 

###### All predictions and ratings are not **promised** to be representative of exactly how good each respective player will ACTUALLY become (but we shall try our best). NBA-Predict is just a fun summer project which in no way is intended to make certain players look worse than others. All predictions and ratings are based off factual data. Our prediction model is oriented around favoring numerical, statistical prowess. Things like importance of games and presence of the "killer instinct" are never accounted for.
