# NBA-Predict
A little project to predict which NBA newbies can become superstars.

## Phase 1:
- Predicting whether a rookie will be a star or not based on 1st year stats and tendencies
- Reading data from raw CSV file with data from stats acquired earlier

## Phase 2:
- Tiered projections (solid role player, all-star, superstar, etc.)
- web scraping data from online

## Phase 3:
- Composite ratings
- Prediction summary

###### All predictions and ratings are not **promised** to be representative of exactly how good each respective player will ACTUALLY become (but we shall try our best). NBA-Predict is just a fun summer project which in no way is intended to make certain players look worse than others. All predictions and ratings are based off factual data. Our prediction model is oriented around favoring numerical, statistical prowess. Things like importance of games and presence of the "killer instinct" are never accounted for.
