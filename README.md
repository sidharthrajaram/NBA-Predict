# NBA-Predict
A little project to predict which NBA newbies can become superstars.

## Phase 1:
- Predicting whether a rookie will be a star or not based on 1st year stats and tendencies
- Reading data from raw CSV file with data from stats acquired earlier

## Phase 2:
- Tiered projections (solid role player, all-star, superstar, etc.)
- web scraping data from online
