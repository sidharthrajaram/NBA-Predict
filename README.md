A fun little summer project to predict which NBA newbies can become superstars.



###### All predictions and ratings are not **promised** to be representative of exactly how good each respective player will ACTUALLY become (but we shall try our best). NBA-Predict is just a fun summer project which in no way is intended to make certain players look worse than others. All predictions and ratings are based off factual data. Our prediction model is oriented around favoring numerical, statistical prowess. Things like importance of games and presence of the "killer instinct" are never accounted for. :basketball:
